# Autonomous Mobile Robots: First Steps
## A mini-course on ROS for undergraduate and gradute beginners on robotics track.
### Summary: This page presents a four-day intensive course  on Robot Operating System (ROS) for under-graduate and graduate students. Well-established tools, such as GitHub and the simulator V-REP, and theoretical concepts like navigation and obstacle avoidance algorithms are introduced in a just-in-time learning fashion. The last day of the course is dedicated to a racing competition with small wheeled robots, where all teams' vehicles share the same racing track in a simulated environment. Everything that is learned along the course is employed to successfully complete the laps as fast as possible.
