# Autonomous Mobile Robots: First Steps
### A mini-course on ROS for undergraduate and gradute beginners on robotics track.
**Summary**: This page presents a four-day intensive course  on Robot Operating System (ROS) for under-graduate and graduate students. Well-established tools, such as GitHub and the simulator V-REP, and theoretical concepts like navigation and obstacle avoidance algorithms are introduced in a just-in-time learning fashion. The last day of the course is dedicated to a racing competition with small wheeled robots, where all teams' vehicles share the same racing track in a simulated environment. Everything that is learned along the course is employed to successfully complete the laps as fast as possible.

### Past editions
**March 2016:** The 1st edition gathered Computer Science, Mechanic and Electric Engineering students at the University of São Paulo, in São Carlos. Participants adopted a constructive and enthusiastic attitude, as well as a strong endeavor in fulfilling the proposed tasks.
